# Final Documentation Project (Twitter standard search API)
Created reference documentation of Twitter's standard search API using MS Word for my UCR Extension course Writing Documentation for APIs in which developers can refer to in order to access Twitter data through its APIs (application programming interfaces). 

**DISCLAIMER**
None of this work is done by own; this is Twitter's *original* standard search API. The primary goal of this project is to practice uploading documentation to GitHub, and to gain a better understanding of the different kinds of API.
# Standard Search API
## Resource Description
The Twitter standard search API returns a collection of relevant Tweets that match a specified query. It searches against a sampling of recent Tweets that were published in the past 7 days. Note, Twitterâ€™s search service and, by extension, the Search API is not meant to be an exhaustive source of Tweets. As a result, not all Tweets will be indexed or made available via the search interface.
