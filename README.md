# Final Documentation Project (Twitter standard search API)
Created reference documentation of Twitter's standard search API using MS Word for my UCR Extension course Writing Documentation for APIs in which developers can refer to in order to access Twitter data through its APIs (application programming interfaces). 

## **DISCLAIMER**
  None of this work is done by own; this is Twitter's *original* standard search API. The primary goal of this project is to practice uploading documentation to GitHub, and to gain a better understanding of the different kinds of REST API.
